# Automation Testing for Swag Labs Website

## Introduction:
This README file serves as a guide for automating tests for the Swag Labs website using PyTest and the Page Object Model (POM) framework. Swag Labs is a fictional e-commerce platform used for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Objective:
The objective of automating tests for the Swag Labs website is to validate its key functionalities, including user authentication, product browsing, shopping cart management, checkout process, and account management, using PyTest and the Page Object Model.

## Automation Tools and Framework:
I have used the following automation tools and frameworks for testing the Swag Labs website:

* **PyTest:** A testing framework for writing simple and scalable test cases in Python.
* **Selenium WebDriver:** For browser automation and interaction with web elements.
* **Page Object Model (POM):** A design pattern for creating reusable and maintainable automation tests by separating page-specific actions and elements into separate classes.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the automation testing project repository from [https://github.com/Vipul08081992/Ecommerce_Automation.git].
2. Ensure that Python is installed on your system (version X.X or higher).
3. Install the required Python dependencies using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. Set up the PyTest configurations and specify the test environment details (e.g., base URL).
5. Write test scripts using PyTest, Selenium WebDriver, and the Page Object Model.

## Test Scenarios:
1. Login functionality test cases.
2. Product catalog browsing and search functionality test cases.
3. Add to cart and shopping cart management test cases.
4. Checkout process test cases, including shipping information, payment, and order review.
5. Account management test cases, including profile update and password reset.
6. Product reviews and ratings test cases.
7. Responsive design test cases for different devices and screen sizes.
8. Performance testing scenarios to measure page load times and server response.

## Running Tests:
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Execute the PyTest command to run the tests: pytest.
* View the test results and reports generated by PyTest.
